# Video Assets

Place your project demo videos here with these exact names:

- `portfolio-demo.mp4` - Demo of your portfolio website
- `masjid-connect-demo.mp4` - Demo of the Masjid Connect app  
- `lost-and-found-demo.mp4` - Demo of the Lost and Found portal

## Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4 (recommended)
- Size: Under 50MB for web performance
- Resolution: 1080p or lower for faster loading
- Duration: 30-60 seconds for best user experience

## If videos don't exist:
The component will show a fallback message and the project screenshot instead.

## Testing:
After adding videos, they should be accessible at:
- `http://localhost:8080/assets/portfolio-demo.mp4`
- `http://localhost:8080/assets/masjid-connect-demo.mp4` 
- `http://localhost:8080/assets/lost-and-found-demo.mp4`
